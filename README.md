# Hi all! 👋

A little bit about myself: 😊

✅ My name is Roma, I am 27 years old 🙋‍♂️

✅ In my free time I like to travel and explore new places ✈️

✅ I love summer, sea/ocean, night walks, bars, swimming and dinners on verandahs 😂

✅ Can't do without sports: soccer, basketball, morning runs (5 km), home training 💪

✅ Studying English so I can get a job and understand almost the whole world 🎉

✅ Developing in my field: reading books, taking courses, developing pet projects and waconsulting with a mentor 👨‍💻

Briefly about my experience: 💫

I started in programming in technical school. Now I love my job as I enjoy creating new products that help people in their daily lives.

My first projects were on CMS WordPress (Stack: PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, SQL) - online stores and corporate websites. I am pleased to see that my projects help businesses attract more customers and increase sales.

Now I continue to develop sites in different CMS, but I am actively learning full-stack JavaScript development, as it is a universal ecosystem. I am sure it will help me develop professionally and reach new heights.

In addition, I am experienced in team management! 😎 

My team has all the necessary members to create high quality websites: a talented designer, an experienced SEO specialist, an effective marketer and skilled programmers. We work together to create unique websites that meet our clients' requirements.

If you would like to contact me, please email me, I would be happy to discuss partnership opportunities. Thank you for your consideration! ❤
